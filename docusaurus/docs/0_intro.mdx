Renders a react knob component that can be widely customised.

```jsx live
<Knob
    size={100}
    angleOffset={220}
    angleRange={280}
    value={33}
    min={0}
    max={100}
>
    <Arc arcWidth={5} color="#FC5A96" background="#CCCCCC" />
    <Pointer width={5} height={40} radius={10} type="rect" color="#FC5A96" />
</Knob>
```

The base of all knobs is the Knob component which handles all of the user
interaction and calculation of the knob value. The user can interact via
drag'n drop, mousewheel and keyboard. The knobs are accessible by the tab key.

The display part is splitted into the `Pointer`, `Scale`, `Arc`, `Value`
and few others.

One or more of them can be children of a `Knob`.
