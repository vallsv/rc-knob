title: Scale
description: Scale component
---

The `Scale` component draw graduation.

The number of ticks is set by the `steps` prop of the parent `Knob` component.

The single scale tick can be a SVG `rect` or `circle`. Additionally a render
function can be passed as a prop, that will render each tick.

This is useful if the scale ticks should have different colors, or different
tick length for every 10th tick for example.

```jsx live
<Knob
    size={200}
    angleOffset={220}
    angleRange={280}
    min={0}
    max={100}
    steps={10} // amount of intervals
>
    <Scale
        tickWidth={5}
        tickHeight={10}
        radius={45}
        color="#FC5A96"
        activeColor="#180094"
    />
</Knob>
```

## Custom function

The property `fn` can be used to have the full control over how a tick is rendered.

The function needs to return a SVG element.

The function will get the following props passed:

-   `active`
-   `activeClassName`
-   `activeColor`
-   `angleOffset`
-   `center`
-   `className`
-   `color`
-   `stepSize`
-   `tickHeight`
-   `translateX`
-   `translateY`
-   `tickWidth`
-   `percentage`
-   `steps`

Most of them are just passed down from the `Pointer` or the `Knob`.

Additional are:

-   `center`, the half of the `size` of the `Knob`
-   `stepSize`, the size of the angle of one step in degree
-   `translateX`, `translateY` that are needed to put the tick on the correct
    position using the transform prop e.g:
    `` transform={`translate(${translateX} ${translateY})`} ``
-   `i` which is the index of the current tick.
